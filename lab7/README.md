For providing TLS support I have used self-signed certificate. For key generation was used RSA with 2048 bits key length. After key and certificate generation, they were imported to the TLS options of HTTPS server. TLS v1.2 was chosen as TLS version because of its improved cryptography and attacks durability in comparison with TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1
